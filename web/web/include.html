technology - how with a few lines of code you can achieve simple chat application
working in a modern browsers.</p>

<p>Of course this simple example gives you only basics functionality. Further you
can improve it. Also you can consider using this technology for other areas where
it is required mostly one way communication. E.g. client is subscribed and listen
to changes such as price change, status update, live scores, etc.</p>
